# 🐟 Fisch Trade Assistant Bot

A Discord bot that analyzes trades for the Roblox game **Fisch** using live market data from [game.guide](https://www.game.guide/fisch-value-list). Combines TrueVal, Trade Hub, Proto, Demand, Trend, Stock, Market Value, and community trade data into smart valuations powered by AI with local fallback. Includes manipulation detection and real-time price accuracy warnings.

## How to Trade

```
/trade your_offer: 2 Nocturne, Scarwing their_offer: Evangeline
```

The bot will tell you if it's a **WIN**, **FAIR**, or **LOSS** — and suggest specific items to add if it's unfair. If an item's market value differs significantly from its listed value, you'll see a warning.

---

## Quantity Format

Put the number **before** the item name:

```
3 Nocturne       → 3× Nocturne
3x Scarwing      → 3× Scarwing
4 curse 4        → 4× Curse IV
3 c3             → 3× Curse III
```

Separate multiple items with commas: `3 c3, 2 Nocturne, Scarwing`

---

## Flexible Item Names

You don't need exact names. The bot has **autocomplete** — start typing and it suggests matching items. You can also type freely using shortcuts:

| You type | Gets |
|----------|------|
| `c3`, `c4` | Curse III, Curse IV |
| `stb` | Slime Trade Booth |
| `evan` | Evangeline |
| `noc` | Nocturne |
| `crev` | Cthulu's Revenge |
| `rb sera` | Seraphic Rainbow |
| `slime booth` | Slime Trade Booth |
| `heavy glory` | Heavyblade of Glory |
| `pheaven` | Puff of Heaven |
| `reaper` | The Reaper |
| `pearsickle` (typo) | Pearsicle |
| `dutchmans` | Dutchman's Penance |

---

## Verdict Scale

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 🟢🟢 **BIG WIN** | You're getting way more value | Accept immediately |
| 🟢 **WIN** | Trade favors you | Accept |
| 🟡 **FAIR** | Roughly equal (±15%) | Accept if you prefer their items |
| 🔴 **LOSS** | You're giving more value | Ask them to add |
| 🔴🔴 **BIG LOSS** | Massive value gap | Decline |

---

## 🛡️ Manipulation Detection

The bot automatically analyzes items for suspicious activity:

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| ⚠️ **Suspicious** | Unusual price changes or trend flips detected |
| 🚨 **Likely Manipulated** | Strong evidence of pump & dump, fake trends, or artificial inflation |

Appears in `/value`, `/trade`, `/compare`, and `/history`. Embed color turns orange/red when detected.

**Detection signals:** rapid spikes (>50%), pump & dump patterns, frequent demand/trend flips, price oscillation, fake trends (marked "Rising" but values flat), demand/stock mismatches.

---

## 📊 Market Data

The bot shows additional market intelligence when available:

| Field | What it tells you |
|-------|-------------------|
| 📦 **Stock** | Total copies that exist |
| 💎 **Cost** | Original Robux price |
| 🔥 **Sold Rate** | % of stock sold (100% = sold out, scarce) |
| 🏪 **Market Value** | Real community trade price (from active trades) |
| 🚨 **Price Gap** | Warning when listed value differs >30% from market price |

---

## 💰 ROI & Liquidity

- `/roi` — Shows which items give the best return per Robux spent. Sortable by ROI multiplier, value, or cost.
- `/liquidity` — Shows which items are easiest/hardest to sell based on trade count, sold rate, and demand.

---

## Value Change Notifications

Server admins can subscribe a channel to get automatic alerts when values change:

```
/subscribe                    → subscribe current channel
/subscribe channel: #updates  → subscribe a specific channel
/unsubscribe                  → stop alerts
```

Requires **Manage Channels** permission. One channel per server.

---

## Market Analytics

Use `/market` to see:
- 🏆 Top 10 most valuable items
- 📈 Currently rising items
- 📉 Currently dropping items
- 🚀 Biggest gainers / 💀 Biggest losers
- ⚡ Most volatile items
- 💰 Best flip opportunities

---

## How Values Are Calculated

```
Adjusted Value = Raw Value × Demand × Trend
```

| Demand | Effect | | Trend | Effect |
|--------|--------|---|-------|--------|
| Limited | +25% | | 📈 Rising | +10% |
| Very High | +15% | | ➡️ Stable | 0% |
| High | +10% | | 📉 Dropping | -12% |
| Medium | 0% | | ⚡ Unstable | -5% |
| Low | -10% | | | |
| Very Low | -20% | | | |

**Smart Value:** When market data is available (50+ trades), the bot uses real community trade prices instead of potentially manipulated TrueVal.

---

## Tips

- Values update every hour automatically from game.guide
- Use `/roi` to find the best investments per Robux
- Use `/liquidity` to check if you can actually sell an item at listed price
- Use `/market` to find flip opportunities before trading
- Use `/history` to check trends and stability before accepting
- Use `/forecast` to see where prices are heading
- Use `/watch` to get DM'd when an item hits your target price
- Use `/portfolio` to track investments, ROI, and get trade deal DM alerts
- Use `/health` to check if the market is bullish or bearish
- 🚨 Pay attention to Price Gap warnings — don't overpay based on inflated TrueVal
- ⚠️ Check stability warnings before trading high-value items
- Bot suggests specific items to add when a trade is unfair
- If you see `⚡ Analyzed locally` — AI is on cooldown, results still accurate

# 🛠️ For Developers

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Discord Bot Token ([discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Gemini API Key ([aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- Puppeteer (optional, for JS-rendered scraping)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adefulki/fisch-trade-bot.git
cd fisch-trade-bot
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env`:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_application_id
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
VOLUME_PATH=./data
CHROME_PATH=             # Optional: path to Chrome/Chromium for Puppeteer
```

### Run

```bash
npm run deploy    # Register slash commands (once)
npm start         # Start the bot
```

---

## Deploy on Railway (24/7)

1. Push code to GitHub (without `.env`)
2. Connect repo to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Add environment variables in Railway settings
4. Add a **Volume** (mount path: `/data`) for persistent storage
5. Set `VOLUME_PATH=/data` in Railway env vars
6. Railway's Railpack auto-detects Puppeteer and installs Chrome dependencies
7. Auto-deploys on every push

## Key Technical Details

### AI vs Local Mode
| Mode | When | How |
|------|------|-----|
| AI (Gemini) | API quota available | Sends all item data to Gemini for analysis |
| Local | Quota exceeded (auto-fallback) | Formula: `value × demand × trend` |

Auto-switches on 429 errors. 5-minute cooldown before retrying AI.

### Smart Value System
| Priority | Source | When used |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1st | Market Value | When available with 50+ trades (real community price) |
| 2nd | TrueVal | Default listed value |
| 3rd | Trade Hub | When TrueVal unavailable |
| 4th | Proto × multiplier | Estimated from proto value |

### Data Sync
- Cron: every hour (`0 * * * *`)
- Uses Puppeteer (headless Chrome) for JS-rendered pages
- Falls back to axios if Puppeteer unavailable
- Detects changes by comparing with previous data
- Records diffs to history (kept 90 days, auto-pruned)
- Posts notifications to all subscribed channels

### Manipulation Detection
Checks price history for:
- Rapid spikes (>50% in one change)
- Pump & dump (spike + crash)
- Demand/trend flip frequency (3+ in 14 days)
- High volatility (2+ changes/day)
- Price oscillation (zigzag reversals)
- Fake trends (marked "Rising" but flat values)
- Demand/stock mismatch (high demand claim but low sold rate + high stock)

Confidence levels: Stable (85-100) → Moderate (65-84) → Suspicious (40-64) → Likely Manipulated (0-39)

### Fuzzy Matching Priority
1. Aliases (`c3` → Curse III)
2. Number → Roman numeral (`curse 3` → `curse iii`)
3. Exact match
4. Clean match (strip apostrophes)
5. All-words-in-name match
6. Initials abbreviation
7. Substring match
8. Sequential word-start prefix
9. Unordered word-start prefix (short abbreviations)
10. Single word prefix
11. Condensed multi-word split
12. Levenshtein typo tolerance (30% threshold)

### Notifications
- Posts to `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID` (env) + all `/subscribe` channels
- Separates changes into 📈 UP / 📉 DOWN / 🔄 OTHER
- Splits long messages for Discord's 2000 char limit
- 5-minute cooldown prevents duplicate posts

### Charts
- Generated via QuickChart.io (free, no dependencies)
- Embedded as image URL in Discord embed
- Dark theme matching Discord's background
